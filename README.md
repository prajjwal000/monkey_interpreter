# monkey_interpreter
This is a work in progress interpreter for learning about interpreters.

Goals of project-

1. Something working by the 31 June 2024
2. Not becoming a copycat codebase! For this I shall make the language as monkey as I can

Features of language-
# C-like syntax
# Variables, expressions, functions, arrays, strings, hashes and one esoteric monkey feature.
